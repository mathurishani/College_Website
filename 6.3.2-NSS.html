            <p>
                National Service Scheme, popularly known as NSS, was launched in 1969 to celebrate the birth centenary of 
                the Father of the Nation. During four decades of fruitful existence more than 2.7 crore students have so far
                benefitted from this student-volunteer programme in the country. The main aim of NSS is to facilitate 
                personality development of students through social and community service. 
                <br>
               Eduka's NSS unit works
                to bridge the gulf between the educated and uneducated sections of the community. The aims and objectives
                of NSS are to work among and with people, to develop a desire to serve the weaker section of the community, 
                and to gain skills in democratic leadership. These aims are sought to be achieved through a variety of 
                programmes: by means of manual work, working with welfare institutions, educational work, and production 
                oriented work and in emergency. Each student volunteer devotes 120 hours in one academic year. 
                <br>
                Inter-college programmes and camps are also held. In the process of hosting a variety of programmes 
                and engaging in work with other welfare organizations, our students are empowered with organizational 
                skills and get exposure to democratic leadership. NSS members periodically interact with the Harijan
                Sewak Sangh students and invite them to perform at the college. Regular visits are paid to orphanages 
                such as Asha Kiran where volunteers teach mentally challenged students.They also act as readers 
                and writers for visually challenged students from various academic backgrounds.
