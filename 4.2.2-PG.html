            <h2>Application Process and  Postgraduate Study</h2>
            <p>The Post Graduate admissions at the University of Delhi are conducted in two streams: by merit and through an entrance examination. Applicants who fall within a cut-off (announced by the university) qualify to be admitted for PG courses by merit. Of such candidates who have qualified for PG admissions by merit, only those who have registered and applied for admissions on the College PG admissions portal will be considered for admission by the College. 
            </p>
            <p>The other possibility for admission to the post graduate courses at the University through College is by taking the entrance exam conducted by the University for the specific disciplines. Those offered admission by the University (determined by the score that the candidate secures in the examination) are interviewed in College and will be considered for admissions by the College. </p>
            <p>Applicants under both streams of admission (merit and entrance examination) are in addition to following all procedures for application and qualification established by the University of Delhi, expected to separately apply to College. Only those applicants who have qualified for admissions at the University of Delhi and who have also applied at College will be considered for interviews and admissions through College.
            </p>
            <p>The Post Graduate applicants offered admission through College, will have their classes and evaluation of all coursework at the University post graduate departments. The Post Graduate students are connected with the College for all administrative purposes. They are offered an opportunity to participate in the rich academic and cultural life of College. Post Graduate students are provided access to the College library and the Internet Resource Centre (IRC). They are also eligible for a few seats in College Residence. They have access to various academic avenues available on campus, can discuss their academic interests with the faculty and participate in the activities of various clubs and societies.
            </p>
            <p>Post Graduate students at College have the unique opportunity to experience the rich texture of academic and cultural life both on the University Campus and in College.
